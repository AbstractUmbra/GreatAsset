# great_asset Changelog

## Added
- Everything...
    ... No just kidding.

- `great_asset.SaveFile`, `great_asset.enums` and `great_asset.Vector` are the only available public symbols for now. The enums are still incomplete pending more data.
  - If you want to contribute either PR or submit save files directly to me (via Discord or any other contact media you care to use) and I can pull data from it.
  - The reason being - the store refreshes per quota submission and it's a static rotation (apparently?)

### Notes
I'll add some example usage soon.
I'll add a way to edit the other files within the save folder like general config.
The enums still need to be fleshed out and documented, which is slightly tedious.
